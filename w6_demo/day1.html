        //DEClARING VARIABLES use keyword def; vars must be declared before they can be assigned
        var num     //declaration only
        console.log(num) 

        //ASSIGNMENT - assigning and storing data to a variable (friendly name)
        num = 7

        //DECLARE and ASSIGN AT ONCE
        var num1 = 10
        var num2 = 7

        //once variables have data assigned, they can be used in output/input/processing/conditions

        //MATHEMATICAL PROCESSING
        var sum = num1 + num2

        //with assignment, everything to the right of the equal sign is processed FIRST! storage occurs from the result of the right into the left
        console.log(sum) 

        //OUTPUT -- display of information from the program to a user/human

        //output for testing - dev only
        console.log(`Hello World!`) //msg only
        console.log(num1) //value only

        //we can also mix msgs and stored values by using LITERAL STRINGS ` `
        //`${VAR}` will be replaced by stored value 
        console.log(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`) 

        //output for user - displayed to browser page
        //alert() creates a pop-up; further lines will not be read until user interacts with OK button
        alert(`Hello World!`)

        console.log(`alert existed`)

        alert(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)

        //INPUT - gaining data from the user (or somewhere else :D) into the program code
        //when asking a user for input, we need to use it some way, so we store the result from a variable
        var name = prompt(`Enter name here: `)

        console.log(name)

        var last = prompt(`Enter your last name: `)
