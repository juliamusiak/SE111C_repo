         <p style="background-color:pink;">Over winter, I go skiing with my family.
     We ski at <b>Okemo Mountain</b>, in Vermont. In February, my family 
     and I are going on a trip to <u>Colorado</u> to go skiing. We are going with our family 
     friends, who ski with us every weekend, and we have skied with them for over ten years. 
     Sometimes, my family friends and I wear onesies of various characters from movies and shows, 
     like <i>Olaf from Frozen</i>. Skiing makes me happy, especially when I see the view of the 
     mountains and skyline.</p>
